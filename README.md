## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into directories for each major topic covered in the semester:

- **2DArray**: Code related to 2D arrays.
- **BST**: Binary Search Tree implementations.
- **CircularQueue**: Circular Queue data structure code.
- **Hashing**: Hashing techniques and implementations.
- **Heap**: Heap data structure code.
- **LinkedList**: Linked List implementations.
- **Search**: Searching algorithms and techniques.
- **Sort**: Sorting algorithms and implementations.
- **Stack**: Stack data structure code.

Feel free to explore each directory for specific lab exercises, assignments, and code implementations.
